            <h1>PROGRAM</h1>
            <p><br>The <b>World Food Programme (WFP)</b> is one of the largest UN agencies helping 86.7 million people in around 83 countries every year, and delivering food assistance in places of emergencies, as well as working with communities to build resilience and improve nutrition. The WFP is an emergency-responder,
                 with 5.600 trucks, 20 ships and 92 planes on the move every day, delivering food assistance to people struck by conflicts, floods,
                 earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters. The organization implements projects focusing on nutrition while targeting mothers and children and malnutrition in developing countries. It also implements school feeding programs around the world and provides school
                 meals to more than 16 million children in 60 countries. It provides cash-based transfers that allow people to shop and choose their own food locally. The WFP employs around 17.000 staff worldwide, of whom over 90 % are based in the countries that require assistance..

                 Bread for the World (Bread) is a collective Christian organization based in the US, working to end hunger at home and abroad. The organization advocates against policies and programs that allow hunger and poverty to persist and is vocal in the US Congress to change policies in its own countries and around the world to 
                 help people who struggle with hunger. Bread equips people to meet with members of Congress,
                  to write personal e-mails and letters, and to work together with others to end hunger. It works through campuses, churches, and other organizations to advocate for change. It organizes advocacy campaigns to pass or block laws that impact poverty and hunger and builds the political will to tackle deeply these two issues.
