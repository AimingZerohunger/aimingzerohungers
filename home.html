            <h3>Aiming Zero Hunger</h3>
            <p>
                Hunger is an uncomfortable or painful physical sensation caused by insufficient consumption of dietary energy. 
                It becomes chronic when the person does not consume a sufficient amount of calories (dietary energy) on a regular basis to lead a normal, 
                active and healthy life. It is the most common problem that we face right now especially in the urban place. Shorting of food and clean water for them to be productive everyday.
                 It became worst when the pandemic come in our country which already loss many lives and unemployed people. 
<br>
<br>
                Five years ago, the United Nations established a set of goals to help and make the world a better place for all the lives on the planet. 
                These are a set of 17 Goals and are most commonly known as<b>Sustainable Development Goals (SGD)</b>. By 2030, UN is expected to achieve all the goals and make the world better for the generations to come.  Zero Hunger 
                is the goal number two of a total of 17 SGDs. 
                The main goal is to educate people about SDGs and end world hunger with the help of common people by the year 2030. Common people across the globe could adopt several small measures to educate the ones around them about World hunger, 
                and at the same time, try and feed as many people as possible. 
   <br>     
   <br>        
                In 2020, between 720 million and 811 million persons worldwide were suffering from hunger, roughly 161 million more than in 2019.
                 Also in 2020, a staggering 2.4 billion people, or above 30 per cent of the worldâ€™s population, were moderately or severely food-insecure, lacking regular access to adequate food. 
                 The figure increased by nearly 320 million people in just one year. Globally, 149.2 million children under 5 years of age, or 22.0 per cent, were suffering from stunting (low height for their age) in 2020,
                  a decrease from 24.4 per cent in 2015.  The number of people going hungry and suffering from food insecurity had been gradually rising between 2014 and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis
                   has pushed those rising rates even higher and has also exacerbated all forms of malnutrition, particularly in children. The war in Ukraine is further disrupting global food supply chains and creating 
                   the biggest global food crisis since the Second World War. </p>

                  <h4>How to Make Healthy Food More Affordable and Accessible</h4>
                   <p>Food insecurity is a widespread problem. 
                    Even the rich and heavily populated countries are not totally immune to this socio-economic challenge. 
                    It is not so much that the government is lacking in authority and initiative to implement measures to alleviate and mitigate hunger. 
                    In fact, several laws have been enacted and implemented in order to address varied issues on food security, nutrition, access to health services, 
                    and other relevant programs designed to promote human development. 
                    However, the problem is so vast that strategic directions should be carefully formulated in order to smoothly execute interventions and reach the target sectors.</p>
